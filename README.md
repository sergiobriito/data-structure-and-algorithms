# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to my personal study of data structures and algorithms. It serves as a collection of implementations, and exercises to enhance my understanding and proficiency in these fundamental concepts of computer science.

## Data Structures
The repository covers a wide range of data structures, including:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Heaps
* Graphs
* Hash Tables
* and more...

Each data structure includes a code implementation, and associated exercises.

## Study Resources
In addition to the repository contents, I utilize the following resources for my study:

* LeetCode: I actively solve problems on LeetCode to further practice applying data structures and algorithms. The platform offers a diverse collection of coding challenges that help strengthen my problem-solving skills and expose me to different scenarios.
* Cracking the Coding Interview: I refer to the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell for additional guidance and insights. The book provides valuable explanations, examples, and interview tips that supplement my study of data structures and algorithms.
